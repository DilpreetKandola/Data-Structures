# [Data-Structures](https://github.com/DilpreetKandola/Data-Structures)
*My implementations and solutions of certain data structures and problems in c++*

## [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/DilpreetKandola/Data-Structures/tree/main/BST)
*This program contains an algorithm to determine the k-th smallest element in an array. It implements a Sorted Array to Balanced Binary Search Tree transformation technique, accomplishing this without relying on AVL properties or rotations.*

## [N-Queens using stack](https://github.com/DilpreetKandola/Data-Structures/tree/main/N-Queens)
*Contains a program for solving the N-Queens problem with user-defined N. This implementation utilizes a stack data structure to facilitate the insertion and removal of queens until a solution is found.*

## [Queue-Implementation](https://github.com/DilpreetKandola/Data-Structures/tree/main/queue-implementation)
*In my C++ implementation of a queue, I've incorporated templates to allow for the use of any data type. This implementation includes essential methods such as emplace, pop, print, and functions to check if the queue is empty, determine its size, and access both the front and back data values.*
