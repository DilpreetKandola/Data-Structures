# [Data-Structures](https://github.com/DilpreetKandola/Data-Structures)
*My implementations and solutions of certain data structures and problems in c++*

## [Binary Search Tree](https://github.com/DilpreetKandola/Data-Structures/tree/main/BST)
Contains Program to find k-th smallest element in an array. Implements Sorted Array to balanced binary search tree algorithm without the use of AVL properties/rotations. 

## [N-Queens using stack](https://github.com/DilpreetKandola/Data-Structures/tree/main/N-Queens)
Contains Program to solve N-queens problem with user defined N. Implements use of a stack inorder to push and pop queens till solved.
